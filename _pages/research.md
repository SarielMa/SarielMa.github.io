## Research projects:
                                      
### Project:                                                  
-	Proposed methods to improve the following deep learning applications for better robustness:
    -	Unet-based model (nnUnet) for Heart, Hippocampus and Prostate MRI images segmentation.
    -	Multi-task Unet-based model for cephalometric landmark detection.
    -	YOLO V5 for blood cell detection.
-	The experiments were conducted on Tesla V100 GPU.
-	The improved models have better accuracy under testing noises than the baseline models.

___

### Project:

- Proposed a training method via increasing margin ideas to improve the neural networks for better robustness and gave the theoretical proof of the training method's convergence.
- Evaluated the proposed method with residual net classifiers on public image datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, TinyImageNet, etc., and real-world medical images, e.g., Covid-19 CT.
- The experiments were conducted via Python, Pytorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc., on Tesla V100 GPU.
- The proposed method significantly improved the model’s robustness against adversarial noises with minimal accuracy degradation.

## Project:    
                     
-	Designed and implemented a CNN model for a variant-length 12-lead electrocardiogram classification task (from the China Physiological Signal Challenge 2018) via Python, Pytorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc., which achieved top-6 performance in the challenge. 
-	Designed and implemented a multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) model for electrocardiogram data classification (from PhysionNet’s MIT-BIH dataset) via Python, Pytorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc., whose prediction accuracy is 92%.
-	Proposed a regularization method to improve the deep-learning-based electrocardiogram automatic diagnosis for better robustness. The experiments show that the proposed method improved the model’s robustness and outperformed other competitive methods in the paper.

## project
                                                
-	Parsed author and publication data (from 1991 to 2018) from Microsoft Graph database via SQL and Python to build up one author-to-author graph (millions by millions matrix) for each year.
-	Designed a clustering machine learning algorithm based on the Monte Carlo method to cluster the graph into author groups. This algorithm is implemented via Python and R.
-	Defined these author groups’ evolution patterns (splitting, merging, etc.) in two adjacent years and collected these patterns via Python to show how each author group evolves over the years.
-	Discovered the mathematical relationship between each group’s evolution patterns and the group’s success (e.g., the number of citations) via Python and R to get the conclusion, that is, what evolution pattern is more likely to contribute to a successful group.

___

## project

-	Designed and developed a C++ generator via Python and C\C++ to automatically parse the C++ class (the concurrent data structure implemented with the pthread library) and to generate test cases that invoke the class. 
-	Proposed three novel algorithms to optimize the C++ test case generator, which discovered up to 6% more potential concurrent errors and reduced the time cost by up to 10%.
