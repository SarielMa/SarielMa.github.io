I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Miami. I am working with [Dr. Liang Liang](https://liangbright.wordpress.com/). In my Ph.D. period, my research focuses on improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial noises. I proposed variant methods to achieve this goal, including regularization and adversarial training. Besides conducting experiments on basic classification tasks of natural images, I proposed methods to improve the robustness of cutting-edge models for more complicated tasks in medical application domains, e.g., ECG signal automatic diagnosis, MRI image segmentation, Cephalometric landmark detection and blood cell detection.

I have served as a reviewer for many international peer-review journals and conferences, including top-tier conferences, e.g., ICML and NeurIPS, and high-ranking journals in AI, e.g., Artificial Intelligence.

Before the University of Miami, I got my master's degree from the State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was working with [Dr. Peng Wu](http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~wp/). In pursuing my master's degree, my research interest is software testing and concurrency. I proposed an adaptive algorithm to test C++ concurrent data structures based on the coverage criterion.   

Please find my [CV](assets/pdf/LinhaiMaCV.pdf)  here. 

#### I am actively seeking a postdoc or an R&D position in AI/ML.
