I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Miami, under the supervision of [Dr. Liang Liang](https://liangbright.wordpress.com/). During my Ph.D. period, my research focused on improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial noises. I proposed variant methods to achieve this goal, including regularization and adversarial training. Besides conducting experiments on basic classification tasks of natural images, I proposed methods to improve the robustness of cutting-edge models for more complicated tasks in medical application domains, e.g., ECG signal automatic diagnosis, MRI image segmentation, Cephalometric landmark detection, and blood cell detection.

I have been a reviewer for international peer-reviewed journals and conferences, including top-tier conferences, e.g., ICLR and NeurIPS, and high-ranking journals in AI, e.g., Artificial Intelligence.

Before the University of Miami, I got my master's degree from the State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was working with [Dr. Peng Wu](http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~wp/). 
During my pursuit of a master's degree, my primary research focus was in the area of software testing and concurrency. I proposed an adaptive algorithm to test C++ concurrent data structures based on the coverage criterion.
