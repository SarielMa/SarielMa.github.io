Proposed methods to improve the following deep learning applications for better robustness:
	Unet-based model (nnUnet) for Heart, Hippocampus and Prostate MRI images segmentation.
	Multi-task Unet-based model for cephalometric landmark detection.
	YOLO V5 for blood cell detection.
        Transformer-based model (TransUnet) for abdominal organ segmentation. 
The experiments were conducted via Python, Pytorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc., on Tesla V100 GPU.
The improved models have better accuracy under testing noises than the baseline models.
